Assignment for Lab week 9

ERGM 1

Consider the media unipartite data we already used in several other activities class. 
Remember that 
- nodes are media in the USA
- edges indicate whether a media mentioned another

1:
1a Check the data and formulate a Null Hypothesis and one or more alternative hypothesis
that can be tested running nested ERGMs. 

1b In the nested model you have to insert: 
- an ER model
- a P1 model
- one nodal dyadic independent term or your choice (in relation to your hypothesis) 

1c comment on
1) which model fits better
2) significance
3) coefficients either using probabilities or odd ratios
4) substantive meaning of your findings

2: 
2a Come up with a hypothesis different from the one you tested before 

2b find the correct term(s) to test it 

2c fit the model

2d comment on 
1) significance
2) coefficients either using probabilities or odd ratios
3) substantive meaning of your findings
