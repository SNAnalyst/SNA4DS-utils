Assignment data manipulation - week 5

Questions to CZ


In the tutorial Measures I you had to work a little with biparite graphs. 

In this assignment you are asked to manipulate a bipartite network.

1. load the data nodes_bip and links_bip from SNA4DS and make it into a 
bipartite network using the function OR load the two csv files nodes_bip 
and edge_bip from the utils folder

graph_from_incidence_matrix

2. Don't forget to add attributes if you have any

3. Make a plot with the bipartite layout showing at least one attribute

--

4. After that, project the bipartite network and work with both projections:

5. plot each of them

6. extract the adjacency matrix for each of them

7. extract the edgelist for each of them 

8. For one of them create a node list as a data frame and add attributes to that

9. Subset the node list by one specific attribute label. 

10. Plot the subnetwork

11. Take the node list again and add one column using the mutate function and the pipe. 
The column has to inform about which partition you are working with.
